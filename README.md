# React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial

Welcome to the official React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial!

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
npm install

4. Start the development server with:
npm start

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view and play the tic-tac-toe game.

## Project Improvements

Once the tutorial is completed, I have implemented the following enhancements. 

1. **Show Current Move**: Instead of using a button to navigate through moves, show the current move number. For instance, if it's the 4th move, display "You are at move #4."

2. **Use Loops for Squares**: Rewrite the `Board` component to generate squares using two loops instead of hardcoding them. This makes the code more efficient and scalable.

3. **Add Sorting Button**: Implement a toggle button that allows users to sort the moves in either ascending or descending order. This will enhance the user experience by providing more control over move history.

4. **Highlight Winning Squares**: When a player wins the game, highlight the three squares that caused the win. Additionally, if the game results in a draw, display a message indicating the draw result.

5. **Display Move Locations**: In the move history list, show the location for each move in the format (row, col). This feature provides additional context for the players and makes it easier to understand the game's progress.

The goal has been to practice and deepen my understanding of React while making the game more engaging and user-friendly.
